I am currently building out a project in The Experience related to giving. I want to have a place where I present and explain to myself and others how I think about giving back to the world. Right now this is mainly focused on which charities I give to (and pictures of my friends cause I like them). This project is a cork board wall where I want to put thoughts related to giving. This way I hope to solidify my own thinking around giving, and see if my friends who see that wall can influency my thinking in some actionable way. To do that I'm going to put out a suggestion box where people can critique my thinking and choices (and maybe the project at large) so I can see if I want to make changes.

Overall I want the wall to be able to explain.

- Which organizations/causes do I give to? How much of my salary? Why those ones in particular? 
- Why do I give back in the first place? What are my internal motivations? Is what I'm doing effective in helping create the world I want to live in? 

Digging at the nitty gritty internal landscape is probably the more ground up approach, and if I could really nail that I could probably directly map what I want to do from there. If I knew myself perfectly, I would know what I want to do. 

Problem is I don't know myself that well. Sometimes I think I do, but I still change so drastically and so quickly that it's likely I haven't hit some steady state view of the world, if I ever will. So instead I'll start with my current actions; what am I giving to right now? How have I made my decisions in terms of quantity and distribution as of today? From there I'll try to reverse reason my internal landscape for why I'm doing this, then maybe I can reexamine what I'm doing and see if it still makes sense. 

So, step one. Which organizations and causes do I give to? How much do I give in total? How and why do I distribute in the way that I do?

# How much of my salary do I give? 

**10% of my post-tax income**

The concept of the tithe originated in religious contexts, going as far back as Genesis (fun party, btw, for those that were there). In early Judaism they were mandatory, and acted like taxes given that church and religion held held more spiritual, social, and governance power. As Chritianity came to being, Jesus and Paul preached the importance of generocity, but tithing was not usually required for religious participation. Tithing has since become more mandatory in some churches, such as the Mormon church. Overall generocity and tithing, while not always mandatory, has always been encouraged in our western ideals of a moral life. 

Also take every bit of history I say here with a few grains of salt. I am not a historian, theologian, or even writer. I'll reference some stuff, but if anything looks wrong give me a correction. 

I'm not too sure why 10% became so popular so long ago, maybe someone reading this can tell me. In any case, the cultural norm of 10% has been passed down for thousands of years. 

And it's not just an ancient relic. 

[The Giving What We Can Pledge](https://www.givingwhatwecan.org/pledge)

Giving What We Can is an EA organization whose most obvious purpose, as I can understand it, is to convince people to take to above pledge and get them to donate 10% of their income to highly effective charities. 

When I thought about wanting to give I wanted it to be significant enough that if everyone in my similar position copied me it would noticably change the world, but not so much that I would have to significantly change my behavior or actions in the world by the process of giving. 10% felt like it hit both of these. 

Importantly, I have not taken the Giving What We Can Pledge, and do not currently have plans to do so. First, because the way I chose to divide my 10% doesn't meet the criteria for the pledge, I'll explain below. Second, I have suspicions that at some point my goals in the world or plans for achieving my current goals will change to be incompatible with the pledge, I'll explain in a later post.

# How do I divide my giving?

**2% - HealthRIGHT 360, General Fund - Something local and concrete**

**6% - Giving What We Can, Global Health and Wellbeing Fund - Something global and concrete**

**2% - Giving What We Can, Effective Giving Research and Advocacy - Something global and nebulous**

## The Philosophy

### Local and Concrete

I'm someone who is very interested in where the thinky abstract world becomes concrete physical world. That intersection between spaces is fascinating and engaging to me, and I choose to spend much of my energy focusing on that space. For that reason I wanted to split my giving between very local challenges where I can actively see problems in my day to day life, and much larger challenges that span across the entire globe and into the future. 

So a small chunk goes to what I think is the most obvious, painful problem that I see in my day to day life: substance use disorder and homelessness. When I think about what I see in the world that triggers the most compassion in me day to day, one thing takes the cake. The amount of people living on the street who smoke and inject Fentanyl and other substances until they die. People living in pain, people screaming to themselves and others due to a variety of untreated mental disorders, people trapped in cycles of poverty and addiction. It's disgusting that we are ok with this as a society. 

I didn't know much about how to help, but I figured donating to the Haight Ashbury Medical Clinics do more to help than hurt. So I tried figuring out how to donate to them and found that they merged with Walden House to form HealthRIGHT 360. I like their approach to the problem, keep providing the next step in reentry and health and give people a choice to follow or not. I'd recommend checking out their website or talking to me for more information about them.

This focus on local problems that I can see disqualifies me from the GWWC pledge. It does not focus on the most effective charities for the most global wellbeing. My non-conventional thought is it actually might in a round-about kind of way. My hope with donating and being involved in local issues is that I can help inspire people to think about issues they see and care about in their own lives, thereby leading to more energy being put into more issues than if I just put this 2% to more EA 'approved' charities. Even if that were proven to not happen I would probably still donate to HealthRIGHT 360 or another local non-profit just because making a differnce in something I can see and experience feels good to me. 

### Global and Concrete

I wanted the majority of my giving to be focused on increasing the total amount of global wellbeing (for humans). I'm a big believer in the power of feedback and observable results, so focusing on the largest area right now where we can measure what happens over time made more sense to me than focusing energy into the nebulous future with weak feedback. Said another way, solving problems that we know are happening now, and which we have the ability to see in the short run if we are making progress, is more important to me than very long term problems which we don't know are making much progress. 

This feeling very well might be a for me, right now kind of feeling as I learn and think more about giving and global problems. I don't have a great logical reason for focusing on short-term progress and feedback other than I can see it happening and it makes me feel good. I worry that without more thought it could do more harm than good if short-term things look good but have worse long term consequences. 

So, concrete problem that affect a lot of people. To me that's global health and wellbeing. I'm not going to go through all of the effort to figure out which charities are the best at solving that problem, sounds far too boring. So instead I decided to trust people who have put more time into that, and I trust these people because they have a nice looking website, have a .org at the end, and happy go-lucky Aaron took their pledge so they probably know what they're talking about. 

6% into the GWWC global health and wellbeing.

### Global and Nebulous

And I want some of my giving to focus on the largest, least feedback, lets go crazy with our ideas and see where they land kind of cause. I chose to make it the same as the local and concrete giving because it feels like a yin/yang kind of thing, and the symmetry gave me a good feeling of order. 

People organization seems big and neboulous and interesting to me. So I landed on just give GWWC money and see what they do with it. Thinking about it now it actually does seem a little too concrete in that you can model how each $ that goes into this 'recruiting' fund leads to more funds, pledgers, etc. But who knows what GWWC will do once more people are on-board with the ideas in it? EA has already gone through changes from focusing on Earning to Give to more emphasis on careers in areas that do good (rising imporance of talent vs capital for causes), perhaps if it continues to grow it'll encounter another infection point on recommended action for participants? 

Something about the unknowing of the change and it being dedicated to organizing people is cool. And nebulous. What will it actually to towards changin in the world? I'm not sure. 2% it is.

Next post I'll focus on more of the internal 'why' for donations and giving. Why, Myles? 

Also seeing the length of this post I'm realizing it'll be a lot to put on the giving wall. Maybe I'll put larger points on the wall with a QR code or printout of this post near by? Don't really want to have this much text on the wall. Or maybe you're reading this on the wall and I abandoned that idea.

All things in time.
