I've been wanting to do this for a while now. My own little place in the internet where I can put all of my creations. 

Ideas of what I might put here:
- Updates on house projects (giving wall seems next)
- songs
- videos
- links to any code or side projects
- compilations of quotes or other pieces of information I think are notable to come back to
- philosophical blog posts
- works in progress on any of the above.

I've been thinking about how I might start putting thoughts into written word form, and what's more, word form that I intend to be publically viewable. I don't think that many people will read through whatever I put here; it's mainly for myself and to share with other people when the right moment arises. But I will create everything here with the knowledge that as some point, anyone can stumble across it. As such, it will very likely just contain the thoughts that I find acceptable to put out in public. This isn't anything  new to me, I often go back and look myself up to make sure that what is immediately available to find isn't too embarassing. 

But I also know myself well enough at this point to know that not everything I want to keep for my own sake I want to be found by everyone. We all have different aspects of ourselves that we show to others, and to different people that we care about. So very likely everything here will remain mostly(?) accessable for the random traveler to stumble upon. 

But I might leave some clues for the particularly observent of travelers.

Also, anything dated before this post was something that was found from the past and dragged into the archives. I wasn't born today, and I'm pretty sure I did some stuff in the past that I'd like to remember.
