This film is a serious piece about the morning after "Chasing the Dragon." It shows the time after all the excitement. When life is back to normal, but it feels like all color is gone from the world. The film highlights how "chasing the dragon" is all consuming, eating into every aspect of the day. When it's all that can be thought about and nothing can push the feeling away. What at first seemed like a fun thing to do to pass the time has slowly destroyed all that used to have meaning and filled in the hole with itself. I'm hoping to win a few best actor in a drama for this one.
